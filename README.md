# DeepThought-ReThought

## Overview

DeepThought-ReThought is an experimental Artificial Intelligence project exploring the frontiers of computational efficiency and capability under the significant constraint of a "zero-budget" development model[cite: 1, 2]. Inspired by the "DeepThought Ultimate" concept outlined in the associated feasibility analysis[cite: 1], this project aims to leverage open-source software, cutting-edge AI techniques, and resource-conscious architectural patterns to build a powerful and adaptable AI system with minimal financial expenditure[cite: 3].

The core philosophy emphasizes[cite: 335]:
* **Algorithmic Optimization**: Minimizing computational cost at every step.
* **Resource Sharing**: Using techniques like Multi-Task Learning.
* **Hardware Efficiency**: Targeting accessible, low-power platforms (though development uses modern hardware).
* **Data Minimalism**: Employing compression, pruning, and distillation.
* **Open-Source Reliance**: Building upon the vast ecosystem of freely available tools, models, and datasets.

## Current Status (As of 2025-04-20)

* **Core Architecture**: A foundational Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) using NATS/JetStream is implemented and functional[cite: 430].
* **Modules**: Basic stub modules representing core components (InputHandler, MemoryStub, LLMStub, OutputHandler) are in place and communicate via defined events[cite: 431, 433].
* **Testing**: Initial integration tests for the EDA flow are passing[cite: 434].
* **Next Steps**: Currently focused on implementing and optimizing the Language Model (LLM) component (Roadmap Step 3) by fine-tuning a small, efficient open-source model (like Llama 3.2 3B [cite: 644]) using QLoRA [cite: 582] and preparing for post-training quantization[cite: 649]. Exploration of a Knowledge Graph backend (Roadmap Step 4) is planned next[cite: 445, 446].

## Architecture & Technology

* **Primary Language**: Python
* **Core Architecture**: Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) [cite: 101]
    * **Event Bus**: NATS / JetStream [cite: 430]
* **Planned Components**:
    * **LLM**: Optimized small language models (<3B parameters) using techniques like QLoRA PEFT and PTQ (e.g., AWQ)[cite: 339, 649].
    * **Knowledge Memory**: Open-source Graph Database (e.g., Memgraph, ArangoDB, Neo4j - selection TBD)[cite: 337].
    * **Adaptive Code Generation**: Potential use of template engines or JIT compilation (e.g., AsmJit) for specific optimizations[cite: 340, 344].
    * **Neuromorphic Processing**: Long-term research goal, likely explored via simulation (e.g., Nengo) initially[cite: 353].
* **Key Libraries**: `transformers`, `peft`, `trl`, `datasets`, `bitsandbytes`, `nats-py`, `pytest` (for testing).

## Setup & Installation

*(Placeholder: Add detailed setup instructions here later)*

Requires:
* Python (e.g., 3.9+)
* Access to a NATS server (local or remote)
* Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` - *to be created*)
* For LLM fine-tuning: An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed is highly recommended.
