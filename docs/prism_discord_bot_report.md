# Discord Bot Integration with Prism: Full Report

This document captures the detailed phase plan for integrating a Discord bot with the Prism system. It mirrors the instructions provided in the latest planning discussion so contributors can reference them directly.

---

## Phase 1: Core Bot Infrastructure for Prism Integration

### 1. Bot Initialization and Configuration

- **Create a Discord application and bot** with `MESSAGE CONTENT`, `GUILD MEMBERS`, and `GUILD PRESENCES` intents enabled.
- **Set up a Python project** with a virtual environment and install `discord.py` and `aiohttp`.
- **Initialize `bot.py`** to start the bot and print a message once connected.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis Integration

- Choose a sentiment analysis library such as **TextBlob** or **VADER**.
- Add logic in `on_message` to compute sentiment for each incoming message.

### 3. Social Graph Construction

- Use **SQLite** via `aiosqlite` to log interactions (user ID, channel or target ID, timestamp).
- Update `on_message` to record interactions in the database.

### 4. Situational Awareness and Behavioral Logic

- Periodically monitor activity in a channel. If it is quiet, prompt a conversation.
- Introduce a small delay before responding to simulate "thinking".

### 5. Integration with Prism

- Expose an HTTP endpoint in Prism to receive data from the bot.
- Send interaction and sentiment data from the bot to this endpoint using `aiohttp`.

## Phase 2: Behavioral Intelligence, Memory, and Social Dynamics

### 1. Persistent Memory and Recall

- Add a `memories` table to store notable messages with sentiment scores.
- Provide a function to recall recent memories for a user.

### 2. Multi-Agent Awareness and Interaction

- Track active users and bots in a channel to avoid crowding.
- Optionally chat with other bots when the room is idle.

### 3. Dynamic Posting Behavior

- Post automatically after long idle periods using generated prompts or GPT-based text.

### 4. Snide or Provocative Commentary (with Guardrails)

- Detect bullying and sometimes respond with sarcasm while respecting `do_not_mock` flags.

### 5. Emotionally-Aware Thematic Modeling

- Aggregate sentiment trends per user and channel to tag themes like conflict or support.

### 6. Internal State & Theory of Mind

- Maintain hidden theories about users in a `theories` table with confidence scores.

### 7. Delay and Extended Compute Pipeline

- Queue certain messages for deeper analysis and reply later with a thoughtful response.

These phases outline the desired features for the Discord bot as it connects to Prism. Developers should consult this report when implementing new functionality or reviewing existing modules.
