# Deployment Hardware Considerations

DeepThought-ReThought aims for efficiency, but specific hardware needs depend on the deployed components and workload. Below are general guidelines:

## NATS Server

*   **Requirements**: Can run on modest hardware (e.g., 1-2 CPU cores, 1-2GB RAM).
*   **Scaling**: Resource needs (CPU, RAM, disk I/O) scale with message volume, number of streams/consumers, and persistence requirements (e.g., if using file-based storage for JetStream). For high-throughput scenarios, faster CPUs and more RAM will be beneficial.

## Python EDA Modules

*   **Requirements**: Generally lightweight. Resource needs (CPU, RAM) depend on the complexity of message processing logic within each module and the volume of messages they handle.
*   **Scaling**: If a module performs computationally intensive tasks upon receiving a message, its CPU usage will increase. High message throughput might require more RAM for buffering or managing state.

## LLM Component

Hardware requirements for the Language Model component vary significantly between inference and fine-tuning.

*   **Inference with Optimized LLM (e.g., Llama 3.2 3B QLoRA):**
    *   **GPU (Recommended):** A modern GPU with at least 6-8GB of VRAM is recommended for good performance (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060/4060 or equivalent). More VRAM allows for larger batch sizes if handling concurrent requests.
    *   **CPU (Possible):** CPU-based inference is possible but will be significantly slower and may not be suitable for real-time applications. Requires a CPU with good single-core performance and sufficient RAM to hold model weights.
    *   **RAM:** Besides VRAM for the model on GPU, ensure sufficient system RAM (e.g., 16GB+) for the OS and other processes.

*   **Fine-tuning (`train_script.py`):**
    *   **GPU (Necessary):** A powerful GPU is essential for fine-tuning. Examples include NVIDIA RTX 30xx/40xx series, A-series data center GPUs, or equivalent AMD GPUs with good ROCm support.
    *   **VRAM:** Substantial VRAM is critical.
        *   **12GB+ VRAM:** Recommended as a minimum for models like Llama 3.2 3B with QLoRA.
        *   **24GB+ VRAM:** Strongly recommended for larger batch sizes, potentially larger models, or more complex fine-tuning setups. This allows for more stable training and faster experimentation.
    *   **CPU:** A multi-core CPU is beneficial for data loading and preprocessing.
    *   **RAM:** 32GB of system RAM or more is recommended.
    *   **Storage:** Fast SSD storage (NVMe) is helpful for quick dataset loading and saving checkpoints.

## Unity Client (if used)

*   **Requirements**: Standard Unity hardware requirements apply, depending on the complexity of the Unity application itself.
*   **NATS Overhead**: The overhead of NATS communication within a Unity client is typically minimal and should not significantly impact overall performance unless message frequency is extremely high.

Always monitor resource usage in your specific deployment to identify bottlenecks and adjust hardware as needed.
