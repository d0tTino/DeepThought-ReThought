# User Setup Log

This file is intended as a space for users to optionally log their specific environment setup steps, encountered issues, and resolutions when working with the DeepThought-ReThought project.

It is **not** meant to be a comprehensive, official setup guide. The primary setup instructions are located in the main `README.md` file.

Think of this as a personal or collaborative scratchpad. For example, you might note:

*   Specific versions of CUDA, cuDNN, or other drivers you installed.
*   Python virtual environment commands particular to your system.
*   Workarounds for unexpected errors or dependency conflicts.
*   Configuration tweaks you made for your NATS server.
*   Steps taken to get `train_script.py` running on your specific hardware.

By sharing these notes (if you choose to commit them to your fork or a PR), you might help others who encounter similar situations. However, there's no obligation to use this file.

**Example Entry:**

```
Date: 2023-10-27
User: MyUserName
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Python: 3.10.12 (venv)
NATS Server: v2.9.21 (Docker)

Issue: `bitsandbytes` failed to install via pip due to missing libcudart.so.
Resolution: Ensured CUDA toolkit was correctly installed and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` included `/usr/local/cuda/lib64`.
Command: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64` added to `.bashrc`.

Notes: Had to install `build-essential` and `cmake` first for `bitsandbytes` to compile.
```
